### **About myself and work history**

I'm studying at the Yugra State University with **Bachelor of Social Work**.

The first serious job was the position of a **specialist in youth work**. It was fun, but I was tired after two years of municipal work.  

I started working as a **content manager** in the spring of 2022. At the same time, I completed a course in Stepik on Python.  

Now I work at a programming school. **I teach Python, Graphic Design and Visual Programming.**  

I hope studying at RS School will help me to become a frontend developer.
